Materials for Northwestern University's course [CS 214: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I, Winter 2024](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/214.html).

I received a perfect score on every homework, but failed one test on the final project. The testing reports for the project and the first homework are included, but not the others -- I got them right on the first submission, so the reports won't be helpful. 

My first project document was deemed unsatisfactory because I drew the entity-relation diagram (ERD) incorrectly. I misunderstood what an ERD was supposed to be, and wrote out the abstract data type I planned to use to represent each relation instead of the nature of the relation itself (many-to-one, one-to-one, etc). I'd recommend checking out the ERD cheetsheat included with lectures 11 and 12 to correctly complete the first project document. My two final project documents were satisfactory.
